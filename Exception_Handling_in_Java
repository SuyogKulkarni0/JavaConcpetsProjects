Exception Handling in Java

Java has Parent Class Throwable as for Exception handling
There are two classes for Error and Exception handling as child class :
1. Error
      The error caused by this class are unhadleable 
      Like NoClassDefinationFound,OutOfMemory,NoSuchMethodFound 
      These can not be handled on the go that is on runtime.
2. Exception :
      This class has a child class called RuntimeException. RuntimeException handles the error that are called unchecked exceptions like ArithmaticException,NullPointerException

      Those Exception that are directly handled by Exception class are called Checked Exceptions like IOExceptions,SQLException,FileNotFoundException
